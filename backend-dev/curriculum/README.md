# Use the `.env` File 

The description for this challenge and how to use the `.env` file can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/basic-node-and-express/use-the--env-file).

NOTE: You might have to install an NPM package named `dotenv`. You can install this
package using `npm install --save-dev dotenv` and including it in your code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config();
```
